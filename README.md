# Trello Component

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a web-based project management software organized with boards, lists and tasks.

# Authentication

In order for the elastic.io platform to authenticate with Trello, the
following tasks need to be completed:

* An admin must manually add an APIKey and Secret as environment variables
  * API Key can be found under **<https://trello.com/app-key>** and must be named `apiKey`
  * Secret can also be found under **<https://trello.com/app-key>** (see bottom of the page) and must be named `secret`
* When adding credentials the user (relating to api key and secret) is asked to authorize the trello adapter
* Finally, a token is provided by Trello which is used within the trello adapter

## Creating an app on a trello instance

In order the platform to connect to your trello instance, an app needs to be
created on that instance.  Below are the steps to do so.  Once that is done, you
will provide a valid username and password to the elastic.io platform.  The
platform will exchange that username and password for a token.  In a production
system, the best practice is to create a dedicated user for the elastic.io
platform.  This user should have the minimum required permissions.

1. As a user on the plattform go to https://trello.com/app-key

2. Look for the API keys
